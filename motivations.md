I was (or am currently, I suppose) working in the fashion industry for the last few years.
I found it to be incredibly toxic. And a terrible industry to be in if you want to make any sort of money at all (unless you already have a lot of money).
You could be the best designer to ever live but have little money or social drive and get nowhere, never be seen even after years of consistent work, focus, organization, etc. etc. etc.
On the other hand, you could be the _worst_ designer to **_ever live_**, but have a lot of money and a huge social drive and boom, you did it, you're a "designer".

The fashion industry, unlike the tech industry, has very very very **_very_** little to do with actual skill or ability.

So I left! :) (albeit with the intention to return as a bad designer with a lot of money LOL)
